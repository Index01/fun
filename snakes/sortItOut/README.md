## Sorting demo
Python hybrid sorting algorithms. Built-in Python `sort()` is great but sometimes we want more control over what and how we are sorting. This code was written for fun and demo purposes in ~2020, it shows simple implementations and Pytest unit-tests.

### Quickstart
Create and source your virtual environment, install deps if they exist.
```
virtualenv -p <pathToYourPython3.x> ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then run `pytest` and `python ./main.py` 

### Next Steps
Issues should exist in the repository issues. 
immediate next steps include running a code formatter such as "Black" on the source, automating the unit tests with github actions and more.
